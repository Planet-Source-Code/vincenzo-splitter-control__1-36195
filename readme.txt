This is a Simple control which allows the user to create multiple
panes (vertical or horizontal) as is the case in Windows Explorer.
This would be ideal for splitting a treeview and listview.

Remember to set the ControlLeftPane and ControlRightPane properties.

There are also a couple of other properties you may want to play
around with.

Hope it's helpful!!!!
